		<p class="text-gray-700 md:text-lg mt-3">
			My dream as a child was being a game developer. I was dreaming of building a browser-based MMO. I first used
			Dreamweaver to build websites but then i quickly realized it's impossible to build a game with it and started
			learning about web development from scratch. I followed lots of PSD to HTML tutorials and learnt about algorithms
			with JavaScript.

			High School
		</h1>

		<p class="text-gray-700 md:text-lg mt-3">
			I left high school at 10th grade to have more time to build games and learn English. I got pretty good at English
			and started using Unity to build games. I worked at over 20 games, 3 of which published on Google Play. I was
			still learning web development in the meantime, svelte was my go-to framework and it was really easy to switch to
			Vue after Vue 3 came out.
